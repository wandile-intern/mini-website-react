      <p>
        Hi, I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Bitcube, currently learning the ropes of web
        development and software design. I'm passionate about building things that solve real
        problems, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies to grow my skills. While I'm not a
        pro yet, I'm committed to improving every day and excited about the journey ahead.
